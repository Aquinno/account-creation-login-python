V 1.0 = Was a script without any lib but import time. Creating accounts, an Sign-In was just a one-time-experience. 
You could create multiple accounts and tests them, working very well. But didn't save any data from the
accounts.

V 2.0 = Improved my skills at Python, learned the basics of Pandas, and introduced DataFrames to the script. Now accounts are saved on and csv file named 'data.csv'.
